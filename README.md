# 👋 Hi there, I'm Muhammad Junaid

🎯 **Machine Learning Engineer in Progress | DevOps Engineer | Kubestronaut**

### 🚀 Ongoing Journey Toward ML Excellence (2025)

I'm currently on a **9-month, structured roadmap** to master Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and MLOps — while strengthening deployment and real-world project skills.

🧠 My foundations are already built through:
- ✅ 4+ months of learning ML/DL/CV/NLP via AlNafi's AI track and Irfan Malik's YouTube content.  
- ✅ 2 months of essential ML math from Khan Academy and CampusX Youtube channel.  
- ✅ Multiple small projects, data cleaning, preprocessing, and model training experience

Now, I'm focused on **deepening expertise** through advanced projects, daily DSA practice, and MLOps tools — building a job-ready portfolio.

### 🛠️ Focus Areas
- Python, Git, OOP, DSA
- Classical ML (scikit-learn)
- Deep Learning with PyTorch
- Computer Vision (CNNs, YOLOv5, OpenCV)
- NLP Basics
- Deployment (Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit, AWS)
- MLOps (CI/CD, MLflow, Airflow)
